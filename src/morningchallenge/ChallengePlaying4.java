/*Playing Cat

The cats spend most of the day playing. In particular, they play if the temperature is between 25 and 35 (inclusive).

Write a method isCatPlaying that has 2 parameters. The method needs to return true if the cat is playing, otherwise, return false.

1st parameter should be of type boolean and be named summer it represents if it is summer.
2nd parameter represents the temperature and is of type int with the name temperature.

OutPut:
isCatPlaying(true, 10) should return false since temperature is not  in range 25-35

isCatPlaying(false, 36) should return false since the temperature is not in the range 25-35(summer parameter is false)

isCatPlaying(false, 35) should return true since the temperature is in the range 25-45

Note:
The isCatPlaying() method needs to be defined as public static */

public class ChallengePlaying4 {
    public static boolean isCatPlaying(boolean summer, int temperature) {
        if (summer) {
            if (temperature >= 25 && temperature <= 35) {

                return true;
            } else {
                return false;
            }
        } else {
            if (temperature >= 25 && temperature <= 35) {
                return true;

            }
        }
        return false;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(isCatPlaying(true,10));
        System.out.println(isCatPlaying(false,36));
        System.out.println(isCatPlaying(false,35));
        System.out.println(isCatPlaying(true,36));
    }

}
